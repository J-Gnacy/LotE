# LotE

A cRPG created in Unreal Engine 4, mainly in blueprints. Due to the project's size during development only desktop version of github was used.
This repository contains only code-related assets, such as blueprints, c++ files and assets required for the code to work due to the references etc.
Folder "LoTE_CPP" contains the code, and "Blueprints" contains the blueprint assets.

Lords of the Edges was originally a pen and paper fantasy roleplaying game I started creating back in 2018.
In September 2020 the Unreal Engine project "LoTE" was created. "Lords of The Edges" sole purpose was to implement the rules of its paper counterpart.
During this time equipment system and turn based combat system were designed and implemented.
One year later, story was added, and the game have been renamed to LotE: Old Man and the Edge". The dialogues were written in Articy: Draft 3, and the dialogue system was created using Articy libraries. Game's interface and story are written in Polish, because the game was an university project at start. 
In January 2022 game's prologue have become fully playable.
